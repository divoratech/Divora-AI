<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

Take control of your AI models with full ownership. No APIs, no monopoliesâ€”just full code transparency and the ability to train models from scratch. Access the source code and take the reins of your own AI projects.

Here's why this project was created:
* Nobody at the time owned their models.
* You never really have the powered you thought you needed.
* You should be free, free to do and create what you can only dream of.

Of course, it is expected for you to use this responsibly, everything you do or create must align with your country's laws, and may not be used to inflict harm.

Use the `commands below` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is will walk you through installing it. Note, this project is intended to be ran on MacOS. I hope in the near future that windows will be an option. If you don't have access to a Mac, you can run this in a Google Colab Notebook.

### Run the first command in VS Code.

  ```
  python3 -m pip install divora
  ```

### Installation

Make sure you download the Source Code to run the python module. The code you need to run will be in the Divora AI folder. Also before running, make sure you already had a directory opened before running this. After all these steps are completed, open finder, find the directory to the zip file, and then exstract it.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/divoratech/Divora-AI.git
   ```
